10/15/19 Today we learned how to use git and its properties. 

10/16/19 Today was an extension on on topics I had learned in college such as HTML, CSS, & BOOTSTRAP. 
10/17/19 Today was cool I was able to connect some of the dots I had learned when I first in college. 
10/21/19 Today went over Boolean Expressions. We linked our Html to our Javascript.
Now I am catching up from the day I missed. Later today I will be finishing up my Portfolio Project. What is blocking me is not having my coumputer and just remembering how to use these subjects.
